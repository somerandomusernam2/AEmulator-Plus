# AEmulator Sunset modification notice

**AEmulator Sunset** is a modified fork of
[uxazu/AEmulator](https://github.com/uxazu/AEmulator). It remains licensed
under the GNU General Public License, version 3; see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

The upstream project grew from the HTC Desire HD and HTC One M7 emulators by
the [original engine author](https://t.me/istratiit_ech). Those credits and the
upstream Git history are intentionally preserved.

## Fork changes

**Modification notice updated 2026-10-04 for sunset.30.** This work has been
modified by drel4 and contributors to AEmulator Sunset. Original copyright,
license notices, credits and Git history are retained; no upstream authorship
is claimed for Sunset's additions.

Changes made by drel4 and contributors to this fork are recorded in Git. The
initial AEmulator Sunset release was prepared on 2026-09-30 and includes:

- AEmulator Sunset naming, repository links, versioning, and orange visual
  identity;
- removal of the upstream project's donation promotion;
- Android 4/Holo-inspired guest navigation controls;
- update checks redirected to the fork's own GitHub releases;
- an explicit focus on Sony Xperia ZR and international Samsung Galaxy S5 ROM
  compatibility.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-01 (sunset.6 through sunset.16):

- Sony/legacy Android service, network and setup-flow compatibility changes;
- configurable Holo navigation and native relative-motion trackball input;
- Sony KitKat audio ABI support and a guest-to-host vibration bridge;
- hidden-menu/back-gesture option and Russian translations;
- a Keyguard scheduling trial in sunset.10, rolled back in sunset.11;
- an experimental host camera HAL1 bridge and reversible legacy HAL discovery;
- opt-in, per-ROM setup skipping with reversible package enabled-state records;
- a configurable ROM catalog, compact section index and browser download links;
- persistent 42-tap experimental-feature unlocking.

Modifications dated 2026-10-02 (sunset.17):

- navbar key-down/key-up holding, including guest Home long-press actions;
- a Minimize menu action returning to the library without stopping the guest;
- updated modification notices, packaged license/notices and build/source audit.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-02 (sunset.18):

- Minimize grouped with reboot/shutdown controls at the bottom of the menu;
- host Back closes logs before any guest Back or hidden-menu action;
- live cross-process VM status changes active guests' Start button to Open,
  including preparing/booting guests, with stale-status protection on process exit.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-02 (sunset.19):

- replaced alarm-based VM relaunch with a foreground main-process restart
  activity that waits for the old VM process's Binder death before booting;
- retained normal/recovery boot targets and guarded duplicate stop/reboot requests.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-02 (sunset.20):

- exposed Sony's default automatic camera mode shell in the host HAL to avoid
  a missing-mode settings crash; proprietary scene detection remains unavailable;
- added native capability/round-trip regression checks and documented Sony's
  app-owned capability cache and device-testing limits.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-02 (sunset.21):

- added bounded YAFFS2 recovery-snapshot parsing and CWM system-image import
  from standalone IMG and ZIP/7z/TAR containers, preserving file/link metadata;
- fixed updater APK selection for standard/clone variants and validated the
  downloaded/installed APK package identity;
- added YAFFS2 corruption, path, link, cancellation and variant-selection tests.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-02 (sunset.22):

- added confirmed, recoverable guest-data reset with a process-lifetime storage
  lease preventing concurrent boot/reset, without deleting firmware or shared SD;
- added experimental long-press Start for a temporary low-power refresh/input
  preset, leaving saved settings unchanged; added English/Russian labels and tests.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-02 (sunset.23):

- replaced the misunderstood refresh-rate LPM preset with a separate native
  charging-only boot path; retained stock charger imports and added boot.img
  repair for charging executables discarded by older imports;
- removed the library LPM hint/toast and handled fresh intents to existing VMs;
- changed confirmed data reset to permanent no-backup deletion with link-safe
  traversal and stale inode ownership pruning; updated English/Russian messages.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-02 (sunset.24):

- removed the LPM-only charging boot-image repair button, picker, and its
  English/Russian UI messages; charging-only boot and normal recovery controls
  remain unchanged.

Implementation details and release-specific testing limits are recorded in
`docs/release-sunset.*.md`, `docs/sunset.*.md` and the tagged Git history.

This notice identifies a modified version. It does not imply endorsement by
the upstream maintainers, Sony, Samsung, Google, or any firmware vendor.

## Local modifications on top of sunset.30

The following changes were made after sunset.30 and are not part of the
published Sunset releases:

- per-image **Serial number** setting (VM settings → Device identity): sets
  `ro.serialno` and `ro.boot.serialno` at each boot, with a Random button;
  stored in the image profile and carried through `.aessvm` exports;
- `TreeFixer.mainStackMaps()` now also applies to Android 5.0/5.1 (API 21+)
  instead of API 23+ only.

## Source and corresponding binaries

Further modifications dated 2026-10-03 (sunset.26): optional host accelerometer,
gyroscope and magnetic-field forwarding through a source-backed ARM32 sensor
HAL; natural-edge navbar layout with upright icons and rounded-square pressed
states; immersive cutout display and opt-in host resolution; Rotate screen in
the hardware-button menu section; optional Samsung boot media service handling.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-03 (sunset.27): fixed host VM orientation,
icon-only physical orientation tracking, untransformed guest display and trackball,
guest WindowManager rotation helper independent of sensor forwarding, app-wide
cutout-barrier and Original/Sunset navigation styles with cross-process refresh,
press-down host haptics and reversible opt-in Google-app disabling inside the guest.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-04 (sunset.29): manual sensor-based rotation
when the host sensor bridge is off; tablet-only host-window/navbar rotation
policy and app setting; removal of the duplicate host-resolution switch;
selectable firmware/settings/data archives, settings import with ROM identity
confirmation, safe boot import for boot-less VMs; and a first-launch advisory
for unrecognized SoC families. New UI strings include Russian translations.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-04 (sunset.30): shorter English/Russian VM
export description; removal of the library toolbar subtitle; simplified firmware
import format summary; simplified ROM catalog compatibility note and removal of
browser-opening descriptions. Export contents, layout and guest behavior are unchanged.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-03 (sunset.28): Host resolution preset,
mutually exclusive host/fixed preset selection and manual-size mode switching.

Further modifications dated 2026-10-03 (sunset.25): portable `.aessvm` export
from VM settings, optional private data inclusion, archive restore through
firmware import, portable file metadata, original boot-image retention for
new imports, and English/Russian export controls. Source is marked in Git.

**Unresolved source-provenance gap:** this checkout contains inherited prebuilt
