## Dated modifications

- **2026-10-04**: fork of Sunset `0.0.0.3-sunset.30`; Plus application changes
  (settings, importers, UI, helper bridges) from this date onward.
- **2026-10-11**: host microphone input. Added the host-side bridge
  (`app/src/main/java/app/aemu/core/MicBridge.kt`, `MicProtocol.kt`), the
  guest-side channel in `native/audiohal/audio_hal.c` and rebuilt the six
  `app/src/main/assets/engines/kk/audio.primary.*.so` libraries from that
  source with `native/audiohal/build-zig.sh` (LLVM/`zig cc`, no NDK). These six
  binaries are now reproducible from source tracked in this repository;
  `audio.primary.default.so` (the inherited HTC-layout HAL for Sense ROMs) is
  unchanged and still has no source mapping here.
- **2026-10-12**: merged from the AEmulator Super Plus fork (itself forked from Plus `0.0.0.2.9`;
  GPL-3.0), by manual diff against the fork point. Only these
  features were taken: European Portuguese (`pt-PT`: `app/l10n/langs/pt-PT.py`,
  `app/src/main/res/values-pt-rPT/strings.xml`, language list and `locales_config.xml`); Wi-Fi signal
  strength and nearby (locked) networks (`WifiEmu.kt`, `app/guest-wifi/**` and the rebuilt
  `aemu-wifi.jar`); configurable fake SIM cards (`SimCard.kt`, `SimSettings.kt`, `LegacySimIo.kt`, the
  SIM handling in `RilStub` in `Stubs.kt`, and the matching `VmSettings` fields and settings UI).
  Not taken: the 3D firmware library and the Android 8.x / Treble work.
- **2026-10-12** (second merge from the same fork): the VM screen theme editor. Added
  `app/src/main/java/app/aemu/core/VmTheme.kt` and `app/src/main/java/app/aemu/ui/ThemeSettings.kt`; the glyph
  sets, colours and press feedback in `HoloNavigation.kt`; the theme hooks in `VmActivity.kt`
  (bar, frame picture, rounded screen corners) and `AppSettingsActivity.kt` (the theme row replaces the navbar
  style switch); the `holoNavbar` flag in `AppPrefs.kt`; the `th_*` and `as_navbar_holo` strings
  (en, pt-BR, pt-PT). Not taken: the 3D firmware library and the other Super Plus changes.

- **2026-10-14**: raw NAND partition dumps (`mtd0.img`, `mtd1.img`, ... as found in HTC Sooner firmware). Added
  `app/src/main/java/app/aemu/importer/NandDump.kt`; `Importer.kt` (`importMtdDump`, hooks in `handle()` and the 7z
  loop); `Yaffs2Reader.kt` (the 2048+64 "sector row" spare layout); `BootImage.kt` (kernel with an appended gzip
  ramdisk, no `ANDROID!` header).

- **2026-10-23**: Android-x86 ISO images (live CD / installer `.iso`, also Bliss OS, PrimeOS ...). Added
  `app/src/main/java/app/aemu/importer/Iso9660.kt` (read-only ISO 9660 / Rock Ridge reader) and
  `app/src/test/java/app/aemu/importer/Iso9660Test.kt`; `Importer.kt` (`importIso`, the ISO probe in `handle()`); the
  `imp_iso_no_system` string; `docs/import-format-support.md`, `docs/x86-guest.md` and the README feature list.

**Unresolved source-provenance gap:** this checkout contains inherited prebuilt
engine binaries for which matching source, patches and build instructions have
not been located or verified. The tagged checkout can rebuild the APK using
those prebuilts, but is not established as complete Corresponding Source for
every bundled component. This notice is not a claim of full GPL compliance;
publishing notices or hashes does not remedy missing required source.
