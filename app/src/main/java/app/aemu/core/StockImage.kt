/**
 * The stock system partition image of a VM whose /system is SquashFS (as in the block OTAs of several Motorola
 * devices). A SquashFS image holds compressed data and cannot be rebuilt bit for bit from the extracted files the way
 * an ext4 one can ([SystemLayout]), so the image of the full OTA is kept next to the VM's files, as it was when the
 * transfer list built it. A later block-based (delta) OTA is run on a copy of it, and the files of the VM are then
 * brought in line with the updated image, which replaces the kept one.
